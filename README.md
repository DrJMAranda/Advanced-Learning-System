#Improving learning and teaching from 200% to 400% is the goal#

##**Everyone learns.** Some learn faster, some not so quickly. Some learn better. Some need improvement. All learn faster and better with proper practice *all learn to learn more efficiently and effectively*. Errors should never be taught and confusion has no place in the halls of Academia.##

###To accentuate the positive I **reinforce learning**. To *eliminate the negative* I must develop and maintain a Pensum which allows students to bloosom their way at their best pace.###
