#From 200% to 400% better knowledge transfer#

##*Everyone learns.* Some learn faster, some less so. Some learners are abstract and some are kinesthetic. Some are visual, aural or verbal. Some are interpersonal or intrapersonal. All learn faster and better with proper support. With practice *all learn to learn more efficiently and effectively.* Errors should never be taught and confusion has no room in the halls of Academia.##

###To accentuate the positive one mustI **reinforce good learning**. To *eliminate the negative* one must develop and maintain a Pensum which enables students to bloosom their way at their best pace. Students should never meet Mr. Inbetween.###
